# USB-Info-Grabber-Script

This script is designed to run on a Windows system from a USB drive to perform a system audit. It collects a variety of information about the network, system, security, and throughput metrics. The collected data is saved to the USB drive in a folder called `SystemAuditLogs`.

The script works automatically when run, collecting data, merging logs, and encrypting sensitive information. Itâ€™s meant for educational and ethical auditing purposes only.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure you have the following:

- **Windows Operating System** (Windows 7, 10, 11 or later)
- **USB Drive** (to store logs and run the script)
- **USB AutoRun Creator - Editor** to enable automatic execution when the USB is inserted.
  - You can download the tool from [Softonic](https://usb-autorun-creator.en.softonic.com/)

## How to Use

1. Download the [CompleteSystemAudit.vbs](CompleteSystemAudit.vbs) script.
2. Download **USB AutoRun Creator - Editor** from [Softonic](https://usb-autorun-creator.en.softonic.com/).
3. Set up your USB drive with AutoRun to automatically run the script when inserted into a computer.
4. Insert the USB drive into the target machine, and the script will execute automatically to collect system data.
5. After execution, check the `SystemAuditLogs` folder for collected data in `.txt` format.

## How It Works

The `CompleteSystemAudit.vbs` script performs the following tasks:

1. **Collects Data:**
   The script runs several system commands to collect network information, system configuration, security data, and more.
   
2. **Logs Data:**
   All output from the executed commands is written to log files inside the `SystemAuditLogs` folder on the USB drive.

3. **Merges Logs:**
   After data collection, the script merges all `.txt` log files into one comprehensive log file named `WindowsUpdate.log`.

4. **Cleans Up:**
   After merging the logs, the raw data files are deleted to keep the USB drive clean.
